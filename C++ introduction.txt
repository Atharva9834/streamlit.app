**C++** is a powerful, high-performance **programming language** used to build software like games, operating systems, browsers, applications, and embedded systems.

It was developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1985 as an extension of the C language.

## 🔹 Simple Definition

C++ is a language that:

* Lets you write fast and efficient programs
* Supports both **procedural programming** (like C)
* Supports **object-oriented programming (OOP)**

---

## 🔹 Where is C++ Used?

C++ is used in:

* 🎮 Game development (e.g., Unreal Engine)
* 🖥 Operating systems (parts of Windows)
* 🌐 Browsers (like Chrome)
* 📱 Applications
* 🚗 Embedded systems
* 💰 Banking & financial systems (because it’s very fast)

## 🔹 Key Features of C++

1. **Fast & Efficient**
2. **Object-Oriented (OOP)**

   * Classes
   * Objects
   * Inheritance
   * Polymorphism
3. **Low-level memory control**
4. **Portable (runs on many platforms)**

## 🔹 Basic Example Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

👉 This program prints: **Hello, World!**

## 🔹 Why Learn C++ for Placements?

If you're preparing for placements:

* Most companies allow C++ for coding rounds
* Very popular for **Data Structures & Algorithms**
* Helps build strong problem-solving skills
